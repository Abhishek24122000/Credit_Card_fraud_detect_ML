 - As part of my master’s capstone project, our two-member team focused on advising two investors, Mr.
Patrick Jyengar and Mr. Peter Jyengar, by creating personalized stock portfolios based on their financial
goals.
### 1. Client Needs:
 - Mr. Patrick Jyengar: A conservative investor aiming to maintain his post-retirement lifestyle. He
planned to invest $500K in equities, expecting to double his capital in 5 years with minimal risk.
 - Mr. Peter Jyengar: A risk-tolerant investor seeking high returns for his company's expansion. He
aimed to invest $1M in high-margin stocks to maximize returns within 5 years.
### 2. Data Utilized:
We worked with 10 years of stock data (2010–2020) for 24 companies across various industries and the
S&P 500 index as a benchmark.
### 3. Key Tasks:
 - Loaded and merged stock data into a single dataset.
 - Explored the data through visualizations to understand stock trends, returns, and risks.
 - Analyzed stocks using technical metrics, identifying those that fit each investor's profile.
### 4. Portfolio Construction:
 - For Mr. Patrick, we selected stable, low-risk stocks with consistent returns.
 - For Mr. Peter, we focused on high-growth stocks with strong historical performance and potential for
high returns.
### 5. Validation:
We forecasted future stock performance using historical data and active investment strategies to ensure
the portfolios met their respective financial goals.
The final deliverables included a cleaned dataset, a detailed Jupyter Notebook with analysis, and visual
dashboards to summarize insights for each investor.
